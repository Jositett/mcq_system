Download face-api.js models from https://github.com/vladmandic/face-api/tree/master/model and place them in this directory:
- ssd_mobilenetv1_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
- face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json

This allows client-side face embedding extraction.
