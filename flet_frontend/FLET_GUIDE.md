## Best Practices

### State Management

```python
class AppState(UserControl):
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_user = None
        self.theme_mode = "light"
        self.offline_data = {}
        
    def subscribe(self, callback):
        # State subscription implementation
        pass
        
    def update(self, key, value):
        # State update with notification
        pass
```

### API Integration

```python
class APIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = httpx.AsyncClient(
            base_url="http://localhost:8000",
            timeout=30.0,
            follow_redirects=True
        )
        
    async def request(self, method, url, **kwargs):
        # Request implementation with retry and error handling
        pass

    async def handle_refresh_token(self):
        # Token refresh implementation
        pass
```

### Component Structure

```python
class BaseComponent(UserControl):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.state = None
        
    def initialize(self):
        # Component initialization
        pass
        
    def build(self):
        # Component rendering
        pass
```
